					For me, Run the Undergrad is the culmination of 8 years of starting,
					running, and learning from several different businesses with the hope
					for impact always being the driving force. I am always pushing myself.
					In my free time, I run (really far), write music, and work on other meaningful projects.

					Growing up in a military family taught me to find adventure wherever I go. Running became
					my constant, pushing me to complete races and climb some of the world's tallest peaks. As
					a Psychology major at BYU-Idaho, I co-foundedGreat Western Racing to build student
					connection and give back through scholarships.

					Run the Undergrad is an outlet for me to bless
					individuals through exercise, community, and financial stability.
					These three aspects have been crucial in my life as I seek to build
					myself and others around me. I love to explore the outdoors, seek discomfort, and obviously, RUN.
